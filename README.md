# Responsive Photo Gallery

This is a small project built as part of the **Responsive Web Development and Design with Bootstrap** MOOC offered by the University of London. While not part of my formal degree program, I’m taking this course to expand my frontend skills and deepen my understanding of responsive design principles.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a **responsive photo gallery website** using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It adapts to different screen sizes and demonstrates core concepts like:

- Mobile-first design
- Bootstrap grid system
- Navigation bar with collapse functionality
- Image layout and scaling
- Semantic HTML structure

## Why I’m Publishing This

Even small projects deserve a place in the spotlight. I’m deploying this to GitHub to:

- Document my ongoing learning and growth
- Showcase my evolving design and development skills
- Build a transparent portfolio rooted in accessibility and ethical practice
